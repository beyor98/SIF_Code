    -- fix spi transfer bugs. 
		1.add CHIP_GM6621 in spi_dev.h, then some register bits will not be used on chip gm6621.
		2.remove continue data configuration in spi config function, it will be configured in transfer function according transfer frames.
		3.remove single wire configuration.
		4.fix some bugs in transfer function, now its tx, rx, halfduplex master mode, and fullduplex function is ok.
        5.remove cvss config.
        6.add flush api.
	-- add examples.
		1.add flash erase, write, read, fast read examples.
	-- modify spi example code, easier for user to use spi transfer.

    -- remove some unused registers.
        1.microwire, DMA_INT,RCONT and some interrupt status and interrupt enable registers.
        2.use tx fifo empty status to replace busy status as fifo transfer finish flag because of busy is always set in gm6601 ti mode.
        3.example code add comment, gm6601B only support spi0, and gm6621 support tx and rx threshold 2 and 4, the others are 8 and 8.
	4.when use ti mode, config polarity and phase as mode 1(polarity 0, phase 1).
