    -- fix i2c bug. When I2C send byte error, we cann't get correct error status 
    immediately, until the next byte be send.
        When send the first byte, we delay some time, then check error status. Just
    the first byte, not others.

    -- fix i2c bug. When I2C bus is error, such as connect data(clk) to ground or
    connect data to clk, the I2C master will not change to inactive status.
        Add timeout check, if not correct in expected time, will return error.

    -- fix i2c bug.	When using I2C interrupt mode send data, the I2C_CommonIRQHandler
    function is low efficient, just one iqr send one byte. If large data transmit, thie maybe 
    cause bugs.
        Add I2C_DataCmdRegManipulate_Data_Cmd_Null function for irq handle, we can send max to 8
    bytes once irq.

	--fix i2c bug. when using slave_tx and master_rx communicate,transfer one byte data,the tx_flag is error
		I2C_CommonIRQHandler add i2c_callback,it makes flag equal to 1.
date: 2021.2.1
	--fix i2c bug.when GM6601B using 400k baudrate ,i2c loop will fail.
		change i2c set_up & hold_time
	--fix i2c bug.dma mode tranfer fail,beacuse dma transfer done,but the flag is 0.
		dma_flag should be set to zero and enable i2c.
date:2021.2021.10.13
	--fix i2c bug.when i2c masterTxMode is GENERAL_CALL_MODE or START_BYTE_MODE,i2c wave form is wrong.
		I2C_CTRL_GCSTA should bu bit9 and I2C_CTRL_GSEN shuould be bit10
