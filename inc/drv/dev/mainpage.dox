\mainpage SDK API Usage Guide of GM66xx Series MCUs

GREE GM66xx series microcontroller SDK is an extensive suite of robust hardware drivers,
system start up files, system services and friendly readable API, it designs to simplify
and accelerate application development on GREE Microcontroller GM66xx series MCUs. 
The adoption of layering structure makes the SDK architecture simplified and improves 
the readability, the drivers of different IP in GM66xx chipset is wrapped, software developer
only need to familiar with the API of the drivers, since the API is friendly designed, 
it is easy to use to develop the application.

All the source code except the start up procedure in SDK is written in C, it is open source
under a permissive license.

The SDK architecture of GM66xx series microcontroller is as the following figure show:
